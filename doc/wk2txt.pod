wk2txt is a command line tool based on the WebKit Engine to get the text content 
of a websites as seen by current webbrowsers which includes the evaluation of 
javascript code present in many modern webpages.

wk2txt can process a whole list of URLs, which can be built by using the 
C<--input> option multiple times or by passing the filename of a list of URLs to
the C<--urlfile>. This file is expected to have 1 URL per line.

The contents of the webpages is written to one file per webpage. The files are
stored in the directory specified by the C<--output> option. The filename is 
derived from the URL, it is the SHA1 hash code for the URL.

By default, wk2txt dumps the contents and the meta data of the webpage in plain
text format. If the C<--xml> option is used, content and meta data is dumped in
XML format.
