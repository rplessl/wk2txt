DESCRIPTION
    wk2txt is a command line tool based on the WebKit Engine to get the text
    content of a websites as seen by current webbrowsers which includes the
    evaluation of javascript code present in many modern webpages.

    wk2txt can process a whole list of URLs, which can be built by using the
    "--input" option multiple times or by passing the filename of a list of
    URLs to the "--urlfile". This file is expected to have 1 URL per line.

    The contents of the webpages is written to one file per webpage. The
    files are stored in the directory specified by the "--output" option.
    The filename is derived from the URL, it is the SHA1 hash code for the
    URL.

    By default, wk2txt dumps the contents and the meta data of the webpage
    in plain text format. If the "--xml" option is used, content and meta
    data is dumped in XML format.
